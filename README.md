# cometwebserver

This is a test implementation of servlet engine in Java. This is not a complete implementation of HTTP servlet specification.
I am adding features to it as and when time permits. But I am planning to add some more features to it so that anybody can use
for local developent.

Almost all of the basic Httpservlet methods have been implemented. But thourough testing is not yet done with the changes I made.
One new feature I am planning to add is support for JSP files. Current implementation lacks support for JSP.

HTTP session has been partially implemented but need a better one.
 
 TODO
  - JSP Support
  - Complete Session Support
  - SSL Support
  - Websocket 1.0 support
  - and so on........
