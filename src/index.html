       <a class="tour" href="http://www.flashandmath.com/advanced/perlinlines/index.html">Perlin Lines - A Generative Art Effect in AS3 Flash</a>&nbsp;
         We present two versions of Flash art which is based on a simple principle: allowing lines to be traced out 
           on a Bitmap with changing directions determined by an invisible Perlin noise BitmapData. The examples include 
         grayscale and a colorized version. The results are highly aesthetic. The images can be saved due to our custom 
           and easy to reuse BitmapSaver class.

       Marble Texture to Any Display Object</a>&nbsp;
         Another example of a texture created completely from code. Our custom MarbleTexture AS3 class creates 
         a marble-textured Sprite with the same shape and mouse interactivity as any source Sprite that you pass to 
        the constructor. The texture is created with BitmapData methods perlinNoise and copyChannel, along with 
        DisplacementMapFilter and ColorMatrixFilter. Choose pink, blue or white marble.

        phones on the Android Market. The version given here runs in a standard browser window. 
        The complete source code for the game is provided, including custom AS3 classes that randomly create

         We present a custom AS3 WoodTexture class for creating wood-textured display objects completely from code. 
         The class creates a Sprite with the same shape and mouse interactivity as any source Sprite that you pass 
          to the constructor. The very realistic texture is created with a combination of BitmapData methods: perlinNoise, 
         paletteMap, and copyChannel. Download all Flash and AS3 source code files.

     A very challenging game which is a variation and extension of the classic "Lights Out" 
puzzle. The goal of the game is to click on the lights until you can get them all to be green. 
Clicking on a light will change its color, but also the color of all of the neighbor 
lights attached to it. The light colors cycle through green, yellow, and red, 
just like a traffic light. The puzzles are made from a grid of lights 
(of varying sizes depending on the settings) which are connected in randomized configurations.

     Recently, we published at the Andorid Market an app which is a 3D rendition
     in AIR of the Rolling Cubes puzzle. Here, we present a web-based version of the
     puzzle so you can play this very challenging and interesting game on your
     computer. We provide and discuss complete AS3 source code.

       <a class="tour" href="http://www.flashandmath.com/advanced/rgbsinks/index.html">RGB Sinks and Springs - Interactive Particle 
       Effect in AS3 Flash</a>&nbsp;
      A new fun particle effect: RGB sinks and springs. Motion of bitmap particles is determined by their RGB components 
     and their proximity to color 'sinks'. Each red, green and blue sink flies by itself or can be dragged by hand. It attracts 
     and repels particles based on their color components. Invisible 'springs' pull the particles back to their original 
     positions. You can experiment with 'sinks' and 'springs' settings and create a multitude of dynamic particle effects.

       <a class="tour" href="http://www.flashandmath.com/advanced/tweengal/index.html">Tweening Tile Image Gallery in AS3 Flash</a>&nbsp;
     We present an original photo gallery with a bounce. The fun feature of this gallery lies in 
     the way the thumbnails transition to a larger image: the image is loaded into pieces onto the thumbnail rectangles, 
     which then 'snap' together with a tween to form the larger image. The gallery is easily customizable via an XML file. 
     We include several custom AS3 classes that make bulding XML-driven 2D and 3D galleries easy.

       <a class="tour" href="http://www.flashandmath.com/advanced/maze/index.html">Perfect Maze Puzzle in AS3 Flash, Random Maze Generator</a>&nbsp;
     Maze puzzles are easy to create. We provide custom AS3 classes that randomly generate
        and render the so called perfect mazes; that is, mazes that have exactly one solution. At a click of
           a button you can switch from simple examples to very complex ones. We use an implementation
          of the classic maze-generating algorithm called recursive backtracker.

      We present a math applet for sketching derivatives with complete AS3 source code.
       The applet uses a large collection of custom AS3 classes developed by the Flash and Math team
       over the past few years. The newest of the classes are related to an interesting drawing
         and smoothing techinique. The user draws by dragging and shaping a curve.

      We present a major Flash project for your enjoyment!  This Flash-based Mandelbrot Plotter 
      allows you to create and save beautiful fractal images.  The application is full of zooming 
       and coloring features which give you a great amount of control over your images. The images

       Collection of 3D Particle Surfaces</a>&nbsp;
       We&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun here at flashandmath with surfaces made of particles. 
       So we present the Stanford Bunny and other new beautiful surfaces with modification 
       of earlier effects, a significant optimization of the code, and a simple z-sorting 
        method. The optimized code allows for revolving in 3D over 200,000 particles.

        In this effect, we use families of planar curves to create and save interesting images. 
        We show how to draw a DisplayObject to a BitmapData via BitmapData.draw 
       and how to save an image from SWF via FileReference.save method. 
         The latter method is new to Flash Player 10.

        Thousands of particles which appear to be made of light form beautiful 
         revolving surfaces in 3D space. We use an additive luminescent effect 
        which creates brighter spots where particles are more concentrated.  
         We present four examples with variations in color and filter effects.

        15,000 particles and the principles that govern motion of particles
           are different from those in Kepler's Supernova and our other popular

       Each instance of the DisplayCube class accepts any DisplayObjects 
        as sides, it revolves in 3D, its sides respond to clicks. Moreover, the cube
         drops shadow in 3D! We show an application with three Bitmap cube menus
            that drop dynamic shadows on the floor beneath as they rotate. We use

      Enjoy a spectacular particle storm! In this experiment we use a bitmap filled with Perlin noise to create 
      an acceleration field. The field controls the motion of thousands of particles creating a turbulent, 
       dramatic effect. We use filters and color transforms to obtain the effect 
        of fading trails behind the churning particles, which change color over time.

         realistic 3D snow animations that include turbulence and wind effects.
        You can superimpose the animated snow over your image. You can create two instances of the class 
            with small flakes and larger flakes, and place your graphics in between the instances creating an incredibly
             real-looking effect. We use Perlin noise, the parallax effect, particle techniques, and physical

     and shadow effect. Our technique of 2D masking and filtering allowed 
     for illuminatig monochrome objects. Here we show how, via additional

       It's the ultimate image flip tutorial. We present two custom
        AS3 classes, TweenFlipCS4 and TweenFlipCS3 prepared
          for FP10 and FP9, respectively. Flip vertically, horizontally,
           customize tweens and speed of rotation. In the CS4 version, we use
           native AS3 3D methods, and provide a way to solve the well-known problem of blurring
          3D objects. In CS3 version we use a custom BitmapTransformer class.

    In this tutorial, we deal with the important subject of texture mapping in AS3. 
    We use custom AS3 classes to paste a bitmap image around
    a sphere and to create a textured sphere. Spheres that we create can be rotated in 3D with the mouse. 
    We give two examples: a wood-textured sphere and a sphere with a beautiful image pasted over it.

    A tutorial by Bri Lance that shows how to create useful AS3 widgets.
 The widgets flip in 3D. One side of a widget contains user controls
    that control the other side. The effect is accomplished by taking a 
'snapshot' of a Sprite
    via methods of the AS3 BitmapData class. Such snapshots are combined
 with 3D rotation techniques. <br>
